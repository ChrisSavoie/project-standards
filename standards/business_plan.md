# Business Plan Outline

In today's fast paced world, every business needs to respect the time of executives and investors. The more succinctly and accurately the relevant information can be imparted on the audience, the better reception it will receive. Modern business plans are similar, and are often expressed in two formats: a 10-15 slide deck, or a medium-length text and graphics format. In either case, the same basic sections and content are required.

## Executive Summary

Describe the project like an elevator pitch. If you read it out loud it would take 30 seconds. By the end, the reader (a busy executive) will understand the gist of your business plan.

## Product / Service Description

Describe the output of your project as it will be applicable to users. Will it be a product or a service? What will the MVP functionality be, and how will users access it?

## Team

Who are you, and what is your background in doing things like this project?

## Finances

Document the past and model the future in detail, so that potential stakeholders can understand the financial aspects of the project.

### Revenue Model

How will the project monetize? Is there a specific revenue model chosen, or multiple possibilities to explore?

### Cost Estimate

Estimate costs for at least the next year. Rather than trying to count every pencil, categorically organize expenditures and be very conservative. Until operational data suggest otherwise, at least double the expected costs and time to complete tasks dependent on labor or suppliers.

### Capitalization

Describe any fund raising or seed capital that the project has received. Note that capital also includes intellectual contributions, hardware, and any other equipment to be used in the development and operations of the project. What else is needed to reach the project goal?
