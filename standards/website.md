# Website Outline

## Content
### Sales Hook(s)

The first thing your website should do is sell your primary product or service. This is true both in the literal sense of content positioning, as well as in terms of priorities. Often the first section of a website is a panel with a single primary Call To Action, such as "Sign Up", "Buy Now", "Download" or similar. This is the thing you most want the user to do, and the thing they'll ultimately want to do if the rest of your website is satisfactory.

### About

Describe your team and the overall purpose of the website. This can be as little as a paragraph, or a whole section with links to personal CVs and other reference materials.

### Project(s) Overview

What do you do for users? Are there multiple projects that the website documents? Give an overview of each and link to a call to action or more details.

### Your additional content

Organized according to interest and thought paterns of the user.

### Contact Form

This is pretty self explanatory. Hook up to your own email or desired contact method.

## Technical

### Code base

Recommend to use [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and fork [Deginner.com](http://github.com/deginner/website), as a starter kit.

### Deployment & Hosting

If you chose to use Hugo, you can host your website for free using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you also forked Deginner.com, you can use it's deployment script to further simplify the process.

## Design

### Brand Identity

The brand identity is how you want your project to be seen. What messages, feelings, and impression do you want to leave users with? What colors and design elements can express that best? It is usually best to consult a design expert at this phase.

### Logo

Each logo is a unique expression of the project. There are general best practices to keep in mind, however, like scalability, simplicity, and harmony with the brand identity.

### Design Mockups

Once the brand and logo are complete, design mockups for the website can be created. These should also incorporate at least draft content, so that the designer can optimize sales hooks and make appropriate layout choices.

### Finished Templates

The final stage of website design is applying the brand, logo, and mockups to the real code. This work is known as "web design" and requires skills such as html, css, and other template languages such as [go html template](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) and [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).
